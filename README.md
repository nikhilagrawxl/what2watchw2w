PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Providing related content out of relevant and irrelevant collection of items to users 
of online service providers. Movie Recommendation System aims to recommend 
movies to users based on content. Given a set of data with their Movie Id, Title, Cast 
and Crew for a set of movies, can we recommend the movies based on the tags of 
the movies given in datasets? 

NEED 
We now live in what some call the “era of abundance”. For any given product, there 
are sometimes thousands of options to choose from. Think of the examples above: 
streaming videos, social networking, online shopping; the list goes on. 
Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find 
something they like. The easiest and simplest way to do this is to recommend the 
most popular items. However, to really enhance the user experience through 
personalized recommendations, we need dedicated recommender systems. From a 
business standpoint, the more relevant products a user finds on the platform, the 
higher their engagement. This often results in increased revenue for the platform 
itself. Various sources say that as much as 35–40% of tech giants’ revenue comes 
from recommendations alone. 

OBJECTIVE 
The primary goal of movie recommendation systems is to filter and predict only 
those movies that a corresponding user is most likely to want to watch. The ML 
algorithms for these recommendation systems use the data about this user from the 
system’s database. This data is used to predict the future behavior of the user 
concerned based on the information from the past. We have to make a ML project of 
Movie recommendation system based on content. It will be a python project and 
will be web based where user will enter the text and will get recommended the 
movies based on tags of given dataset. 

METHODOLOGY 
We will be using a dataset from a website which will contain the data of all the 
movies. After obtaining the dataset we will get the raw data which we have to 
preprocess it for our project. We will be using the python and Jupyter for 
preprocessing the data. After the data is preprocessed we will get the tags of it. We 
have to vectorize it because every movie has so many tags. We have to find the 
similarity of the tags and it can be done easily in vector form. Than we have to make 
the function which will take the input and will recommend the movies based on 
tags. Atlast we will be making the frontend where all the code will be implemented 
and shown. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED 
Languages : Python 
Operating System : Windows 
Softwares : VS Code, Code Blocks, Jupyter, PyCharm 
Python Libraries : Numpy, Pandas, Os, Pickle, Streamlit, Requests, 
Internet resources for Dataset 

CONTRIBUTION 
It will contain only some data. After we can give it enormous data that it will help 
the user to see which movie to watch. We can separate the movies based on various 
OTT platforms in future and will help in recommend the user based on the keyword 
and separate it into OTT platforms.
